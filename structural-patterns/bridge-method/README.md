- In method there is two subcategories: abstracts  and implementations objects.
- The abstract is enable to receive the concrete implementation. In our context, the color.
- The variable color in the abstracts objects is the bridge constructed. It avoids the creation objects in exponential scale.
- Decrease the number the objects O(n) to O(1).

## Requirements
